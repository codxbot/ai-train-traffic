AI Train Traffic Management — Fullstack Project

## Quick start

### 1. Start backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

---

### Steps:
1. Edit your `README.md` in GitHub.
2. Replace the current quick start section with the fixed one above.
3. Commit changes.
4. Refresh your GitHub Pages site — it should now render correctly with proper code blocks.

Do you also want me to **add frontend start instructions** (like I did above) so your teammates can easily run both frontend & backend?
